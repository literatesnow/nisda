# nisda.net

The source code for [nisda.net](https://www.nisda.net/). This website is mostly [static HTML](www/static/) except for the photos page which is generated by a ruby script. In the future it would be nice to build the entire website using a fancy static HTML website generator.

## Building

To populate the ``dist/`` directory, run the [bin/build](bin/build) script. [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) can be used.

```bash
   you$ vagrant up
   you$ vagrant ssh
   vagrant$ /vagrant/bin/build
```

### Photos

Requirements for the first version of the photos page:

* Images preprocessed before being uploaded to the internet ([pepper](https://github.com/literatesnow/pepper))
* Page is generated from photos listed in a JSON file
* Sort images by date and tag
* Images have thumbnails and click through to larger image
* Images have a license
* Title text on images

TODO:

* Camera settings when image was taken
* GPS co-ordinates of image
