# nisda.net

The source code for [nisda.net](https://www.nisda.net/). This website is mostly [static HTML](www/static/) except for the photos page which is generated by a [ruby script](bin/gen_photos_page). In the future it would be nice to build the entire website using a fancy static HTML website generator.

## Building

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is required.

1. Create and edit appropriate environment files.

    ```bash
    $ cp .example.env-aws .env-aws
    $ vim .env-aws
    $ cp .example.env-nisda .env-nisda
    $ vim .env-nisda
    ```

1. Build the docker container.

    * The current user's id and group id is baked into the container ensuring volume permissions are correct.

    ```bash
    $ bin/build_docker
    ```

1. Populating the ``dist/`` directory.

    ```bash
    $ bin/run_docker
    ```

### Photos

Requirements for the first version of the photos page:

* Images preprocessed before being uploaded to the internet ([pepper](https://github.com/literatesnow/pepper))
* Page is generated from photos listed in a JSON file
* Sort images by date and tag
* Images have thumbnails and click through to larger image
* Images have a license
* Title text on images

#### Todo

* Camera settings when image was taken
* GPS co-ordinates of image
