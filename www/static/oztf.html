          As the OZTF site is down (<a href="http://ap.qgl.org/mercury/">http://ap.qgl.org/mercury/</a>), here is a mirror of a lot of the content.
          The content of this page was written by Mercury.<br>

        <h3>About</h3>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>What is Oz Team Fortress (OZTF)?</strong><br>
          Oz Team Fortress is a modification made for Quake World by Mercury (myself).
        </p>

        <p class="quote">I decided to ask Robin Walker if I could create my own mod using Team Fortress source code. He willingly gave me permission to use the Team Fortress 2.9 source code, under the condition that, "Team Fortress Software is not directly related or Liable, with anything to do with Oz Team Fortress." This means they are separate modifications and are not related in anyway but source code. Please do not in anyway contact Team Fortress Software with any problems or bug reports you have on Oz Team Fortress.</p>

        <p class="quote">To download Team Fortress visit the Official Team Fortress Web Site</p>

        <p class="quote">Then I contacted rXr creator of Kombat Teams Pro, who provided me with Kombat Teams 2.1 created by Kombat Teams Software. Omicron with a great coding knowledge created a modified version of Team Fortress called OmiTF, for the Russian TF community. This source was also important in the development in Oztf. </p>

        <p class="quote">After acquiring a number of different sources with the permission of the Software developers I began working on Oz Team Fortress.</p>

        <p class="quote">The original idea of Team Fortress was based on Capture the Flag concept. Capture the Flag (CTF) is when mainly two teams try to steal an enemy flag within an area defended by the enemy, such as the enemy base and capture it within the local team's area or base.</p>

        <p class="quote">With this idea in mind Team Fortress software developed a mod for Quake that uses the idea of Capture the Flag, and adds different types of player classes. The idea is to have the best teamwork and class combination to beat the other team in capturing the flag or any other goal that scores points depending on the map. The fact that Team Fortress has the ability to create many different goal entities make the game-play much more universal. It is much more then just a CTF mod.</p>

        <h4>Version 1.21 Released 21/ 03 / 2003</h4>
       
        <p class="quote">
          <strong>Practice Mode:</strong><br>
          New mode added where the player has unlimited ammo, health, grenades, and will not require reloading.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>CTF Flag Support:</strong><br>
          CTF Flags have been added which includes flag meshing to player model upon grabbing a flag.<br>
          Requires <a href="files/oztf/flag.zip">flag.mdl</a> 
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>Sentry Gun Updated:</strong><br>
          Team Fortress 2.9 Sentries are now the default sentry gun. You can change this using the sgtype command.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>Votetime localinfo:</strong><br>
          This will disable any players from using the break command with a time specifed. Break and Elec tcommands has also added proctection to prevent spamming. 
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>New Setinfo Key added:</strong><br>
          There is a new setinfo key added called &quot;tfk&quot; which intelligently allows you to enable 4 options at once. The reason this was added is to lower the setinfo strings which can cause some problems for many clients. This setinfo will only work on connect, and will not affect any current setinfo setting. The options are:<br>
        <br>
        1 = Class help off<br>
        2 = Exec Class script<br>
        4 = Exec Map script<br>
        8 = Sbar on<br>
        <br>

        To enable more then 1 option, simply add the numbers together. I.e. if you want to enable both class help off, and exec map script, you would set 1 (ch) + 2 (ec) = 3 therefore &quot;setinfo tfk 3&quot;.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>New Alias Commands:</strong><br>
          SHOWFPS - this will show the fps, and current timing speed of all players in the server<br>
          SHOWFRAGS - (previously fraglist) will print a list of statistics
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>New Admin commands:</strong><br>
          PRACTICE - this will toggle practice modem, requires map restart.<br>
          SGTYPE - toggles tfstrike mode<br>
          FLAG_MODEL - this will toggle the flag model between map default, tf flag, tf standard and the new CTF flags.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>Localinfos added:</strong><br>
          FLAG_SOLID - (on/off) this will make the tf_goal entitiy solid despite what the map setting is.<br>
          FLAG_DROP - (on/off) this will allow all tf_goal entities to be droped using the dropitems command.  Old keys there could not be dropped in TF2.9 can be dropped in this version.<br>
          FLAG_MODEL (0/1/2/3) sets flag model to tf_goals.  0 = map default, 1 = tf flag, 2 = tf standard, 3 = Ctf flag.<br>
          PRACTICE - (on/off) will toggle practice mode, requires map restart.<br>
          SENTRYTYPE - (0,1) toggles between 0, TF2.9 sentry guns, and 1, Oztf Sentry Guns.<br>
          VOTETIME - (minutes) you can set an inital time where a player cannot use the break command, time in minuites.<br>
          <br>

          TEMP1 has been modified so that you can enable the above flag options.<br>
          The current oztf temp1 values are:<br>
          1 = Class Persistance<br>
          2 = Free<br>
          4 = 5 Second Respawn Delay<br>
          8 = allow flag drop<br>
          16 = solid flag<br>
          32 = Free<br>
          64 = Autoteam On<br>
          128 = TeamFrags On<br>
          256 = (do not use)<br>
          512 = Free (Removed SpyInvis)<br>
          1024 = Grapple On <br>
          2048 = FullTeamScore <br>
          4096 = tf flag <br>
          8192 = tf stan <br>
          16834 = ctf flag <br>
          <br>

          To enable more then 1 option above, simple add the values together. Ie &quot;localinfo temp1 5120&quot; = Grapple On 1024 + TF flag 4096.

        <p class="quote">
          <strong>TfStrike</strong><br>
          New mode called TfStrike is a mode which enables Counter Strike gameplay for Oztf. It contains two teams , Terrorist and Counter-Terrorists.<br>
          <br>

          -Any class on the terrorist team can set the bomb<br>
          -Any class on the counter team can disarm<br>
          -Terrorist are given a bomb randomly on spawn<br>
          -Bombs must be placed at bombsite<br>
          -Alias '+bomb' sets the bomb<br>
          -Alias 'dropbomb' drops the bomb<br>
          <br>

          Tfstrike works with rounds.<br>
          For the bomb to work it needs a bombsite. The bombsites are specified by info_bombsite in the map entities. It does not require any information 
          but the origin. Disarming a bomb is similar to disarming a detpack, you simply look at the detback and wait. The person with the bomb is given a topcolor of 0, in order to individualise the player. You cannot change topcolor whilst you are a Terrorist.<br>

          If everyone dies the rounds is drawn. If there is one player left in the round, that team will win the round.  If a player completes a map objective (like captures the flag) he or she will win the round

          Speedcap calulates the time flag is taken from the start of the round to the time you capture the flag, or another goal item. Like above if a player captures he or she will win the round and it will print the time captured. (noreturn is suggested for this mode)

          New sentry gun firing mode, Laser. Now has 3 modes. For this reason localinfo &quot;lgsentry&quot; was removed and localinfo &quot;sentryfire&quot; was added, with 0 as normal 1 as lightning and 2 as laser

          Updated Ground Speed command. New option to slowly reduced speed when a player is travelling above maxspeed of that class. This is similar to q3 bunnyhop which only reduces at a higher rate at lower speed to prevent manual bunnyhop but doesnt reduce much at higher speed.

          You can either use the gspeed command to toggle through speeds or:<br>
          Use localinfo gspeed -1 to -3.<br>

          Updated sentry gun:<br>
          Fixed sentry speed error. (Normal sentry speed was set to fast on level 2 and 3)<br>
          Added new algorithm for sentry firing angles.<br>

          The original code allowed a 10 degree radius from the direction of the sentry gun to allow an enemy to be fired upon. This means as the distance increased, the less the sentry gun depended on being in the correct position. Up close if you run around the sentry gun it will stop firing and move the gun towards the enemy and refire. This is now dependant on distance of the enemy. The greater the distance the smaller the angle is to make a more realistic targeting system. I will release a spreadsheet showing the firing system graphically.

          The duel localinfo will give classes full armor on spawn and half their maximum ammo for each ammo type. It also gives them maximum grenades. The golden localinfo is no longer needed as overtime is defined by its value being greater then 1. If 0 overtime is off. If 1 overtime is 1 minute, etc.
