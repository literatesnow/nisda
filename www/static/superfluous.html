        Battlefield 2 server rcon administration program for Windows 2K/XP (also should work in Wine and 9x/ME), the server needs to be running BF2CC/ModManager scripts version 4.6 or later and PunkBuster be enabled.

        <h3>Info</h3>
        It's been designed so player management is quick and easy which means a command line interface. Rather than looking through a list of 64 players to find the player who's doing something they shouldn't, you can partially match their name with <em>m &lt;name&gt;</em> and <em>bantk</em> to ban them. Other matching includes negative score, with teamkills, squad leader/member, commander, high ping, in a vehicle and more, players can also be teamswapped, kicked or banned. The hotkey (Shift+F12) will redirect all keyboard to Superfluous meaning that commands can be issued while you're in game and flying a plane, running Superfluous on a second monitor is recommended so you can see what you're typing but not necessary if you're brave.

        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Very small, very fast and very low memory usage</li>

          Superfluous started off as a replacement to a certain other client which (and still is) huge, buggy and slow. The idea was to build the console interface and create the GUI on top of it, unfortunately this was too useful and rest was never finished.
