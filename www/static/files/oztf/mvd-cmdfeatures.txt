                       MVDSV-features supported by Oztf
                       ================================

Oztf 1.45 offers several new features when used incombination with mvdsv 0.14 
or later. Oztf now also supports mvdsv's server-side demo-recording features, 
however you will need full access rights to use the commands.

This document will list and describe all the new mvd-specific commands and cmds as
well as the localinfos that are used by the server.

The notation used in the commands described herein uses the common
Unix semantics in specifying if a parameter is optional or required:

  - Any parameter description enclosed with < ... > is required.
  - Any parameter description enclosed with [ ... ] is optional.

=====
CMDs
=====


----------------------------------
cmd adminpwd [password]
----------------------------------

example: cmd adminpwd john
example: setinfo adminpwd john 


----------------------------
cmd kick <id/name [reason]> 
----------------------------

This will cycle the admin deal command. It will ask you if you wish to kick the current player shown or cycle next.

example: cmd kick
         next
         kick

------------------
cmd map <mapname>
------------------

This allows map change for admins not from map's list

example: cmd map 2fort5r


----------------------
cmd record <demoname>
----------------------

This is how you record a server-side .mvd-demo. If there is already a name with the
specified name, it will be overwritten. If a demo is recorded, this can be seen in
the serverinfo, as well as how the demo is called.

example: cmd record pug-well6



--------------------------
cmd easyrecord [demoname]
--------------------------

This will record a server-side .mvd-demo. If no demoname is specified a name will be
chosen with the name stating whether it was a duel or team game, the team names and
the map. If a demoname is specified, it will be used, if a demo with the specified
name already exists, a suffix will be appended to the demoname. If a demo is recorded, 
this can be seen in the serverinfo, as well as how the demo is called.

example: cmd easyrecord      - If team red plays team blue on dm3, the server will 
                                then record a demo called clan_red_vs_blue_[bam4].mvd.


------------------------------
cmd autorecord [# games left]
------------------------------

This command can be used to toggle automatic recording of server-side demos. If
no parameter is specified, this command will turn automatic recording off. If 
automatic recording was turned on before, it will be turned off. However, if automatic 
recording was switched off before, issueing "cmd autorecord" will have the same 
the effect like "cmd autorecord 1", it wlll automatically record the next game and
switch off automatic recording after that. If a number of demos to be automatically
recorded is specified, (demo_auto_left) each match will be recorded until the value
reaches zero. be used. Any value smaller than 1 will turn automatic recording off.

The automatic recording procedure works like this: the mod will automatically issue 
the easyrecord command when the countdown starts and issue the "cmd stop" command when
the game is over as well as decrease the number of demos to be recorded automatically
by 1. If the countdown is aborted, no demo will be saved and the counter of how many 
demos are left to be automatically recorded will not be changed, however once the 
match started, the demo will be saved, even if the match is aborted and the demo 
counter will be decreased by one. If a demo is recorded, this can be seen in the 
serverinfo, as well as how the demo is called.

examples:  cmd autorecord        - If automatic demo recording was turned off, it
                                    will be turned on for one game. If it was 
                                    turned on, it will be turned off.
           cmd autorecord 5      - This will automatically record the following 5
                                    games into .mvd-demos (each in a separate demo 
                                    of course), if the localinfo demo_auto_left_max
                                    allows for that many automatically recorded
                                    demos, otherwise the number will be limited to
                                    the value of said localinfo.


-----------
cmd dl <#>
-----------

This will download the demo with the specified number, you can find out which demo
is represented by which number by using the "cmd dlist" command. On non-KTeams Pro
servers you can also use "cmd demolist" to view the demolist.

example: cmd dl 4                - This will make you download the .mvd-demo with the 
                                    number 4. 


-----------
cmd cancel
-----------

This will abort any server-side demo recording, discarding the recorded demo.

example: cmd cancel


---------
cmd stop
---------

This will stop any server-side demo recording, saving the recorded demo.

example: cmd stop
